# STL  

## 1. sort(startaddress, endaddress)

- startaddress: the address of the first element of the array
- endaddress: the address of the last element of the array

```C++
int a[10]= {1, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 0};
sort(a, a+10); 
```

- So by default, sort() sorts an array in ascending order.
- sort(a, a+n, greater<int>());
- To sort in descending order

```C++
sort(vec.begin(),vec.end())
```

## 2. binary_search(startaddress, endaddress, valuetofind)

### NOTE: array must be sorted.

- startaddress: the address of the first element of the array.
- endaddress: the address of the last element of the array.
- valuetofind: the target value which we have to search for

```C++
if (binary_search(a, a + n, 4)) 
        cout << "\nElement found in the array"; 
```

## 3. Algorithm lib
- sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector
- reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector.
- *max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.
- *min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.
- accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of - - - vector elements

```C++
// Initializing vector with array values 
int arr[] = {10, 20, 5, 23 ,42 , 15}; 
int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
vector<int> vect(arr, arr+n); 

sort(vect.begin(), vect.end());//5 10 15 20 23 42 
reverse(vect.begin(), vect.end());//42 23 20 15 10 5 
*max_element(vect.begin(), vect.end());// 42
*min_element(vect.begin(), vect.end());//5
accumulate(vect.begin(), vect.end(), 0);//115
```

- count(first_iterator, last_iterator,x) –    
To count the occurrences of x in vector.

- find(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) –    
Points to last address of vector ((name_of_vector).end()) if element is not present in vector.

```C++
// Initializing vector with array values 
int arr[] = {10, 20, 5, 23 ,42, 20, 15}; 
int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
vector<int> vect(arr, arr + n); 

count(vect.begin(), vect.end(), 20);//2
find(vect.begin(), vect.end(),5);
```

- vec.erase(position to be deleted) –     
This erases selected element in vector and shifts and resizes the vector elements accordingly.

- vec.erase(unique(vec.begin(),vec.end()),vec.end()) –    
This erases the duplicate occurrences in sorted vector in a single line.

```C++
// Initializing vector with array values 
int arr[] = {5, 20, 5, 23, 20, 20}; 
int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
vector<int> vect(arr, arr+n); 

vect.erase(vect.begin()+1);
//5 5 23 20 20 
//sort enables to use of unique.
sort(vect.begin(), vect.end());
vect.erase(unique(vect.begin(),vect.end()),vect.end()); 
// 5 20 23
```


- distance(first_iterator,desired_position) –      
It returns the distance of desired position from the first iterator.This function is very useful while finding the index.

`distance(vect.begin(),max_element(vect.begin(), vect.end()));`
                      
- next_permutation(first_iterator, last_iterator) –    
This modified the vector to its next permutation.

- prev_permutation(first_iterator, last_iterator) –   
This modified the vector to its previous permutation.

```C++
next_permutation(vect.begin(), vect.end());
prev_permutation(vect.begin(), vect.end());

Given Vector is:
5 10 15 20 20 23 42 45 
Vector after performing next permutation:
5 10 15 20 20 23 45 42 
Vector after performing prev permutation:
5 10 15 20 20 23 42 45  
```

- lower_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) –            
returns an iterator pointing to the **first element** in the range [first,last) which has a value >=x

- upper_bound(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) –      
returns an iterator pointing to the **first element** in the range [first,last) which has a value >x
